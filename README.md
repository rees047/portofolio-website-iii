# portofolio-website-ii
 portfolio website created using HTML, CSS and JQuery

 ** August 31, 2021 ** With everyting I learned, I decided to go back to basics. To do everything as much as I can in pure HTML, CSS and jQUery. ( I was aspiring for pure vanilla JavaScript but I'm more comfortable with JQ).

So here it is, my portfolio. This should work on both desktop and mobile views.

People's opinion about my achievements may vary but I know for a fact that I will continue to grow and improve as technology does the same.
